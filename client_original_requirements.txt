EpiSave Website Technical Requirements
1. Project Goal
Develop a highly SEO-optimized, durable, and low-maintenance website to advertise the EpiSave project. Project Description: EpiSave is a seizure detection system for generalized convulsive seizures (GCS) using Android smartwatches (e.g., TicWatch Pro 5) and a companion smartphone app. It provides real-time alerts and SMS notifications with location data to caregivers, aiming to reduce SUDEP risks.
2. Core Technical Constraints (Must Have)
Architecture & Security
Static Site Generator: Hugo (Preferred).
Rationale: Markdown editing, minimal maintenance, small attack surface, high performance.
Hosting/Deployment: Verified static hosting (e.g., Cloudflare Pages, GitHub Pages) with CDN.
CI/CD: Automated deployment pipeline for updates.
Requirement: Must support git push to deploy with a separated staging (for preview on modifications) and a 1-button production deployment when staging is OK. We have an existing CI/CD pipeline that you can use for Hugo.
Cost Control: Must ensure controlled operating costs.
Security: No unnecessary dynamic content or server-side rendering. HTTPS enabled and default with automated certification renewal.
Structure & Content
Presentation: Clean structure, strong content hierarchy, accessible storytelling.
Multilingual Support: Native support from day one (e.g., /en/, /fr/).
Requirement: Dedicated sitemaps and clean URLs for each language.
Navigation:Clear "Donation / Contact" button (visible, accessible, trackable).
Blog/News section (team-maintained, Markdown-based).
Theme Selection: The ideal theme SHOULD NOT especially resemble toha. It MUST allow meeting all technical requirements (Multilingual, JSON-LD, SEO, Performance) with minimal code modification.
Reference: toha is cited as an an example, not necessarily a visual strict requirement. The priority is a theme that is maintenance-free regarding core SEO/Structure specs.
Sitemap: Complete sitemap.xml listing all pages and SEO sub-pages.
Requirement: Even if presented as a "single page", the engine MUST generate dedicated sub-pages (e.g., /services/) and correct breadcrumbs.
Branding
Integration of logos, visual identity, and assets.
Placeholder assets acceptable initially if final versions are unavailable.
3. SEO & Performance (Must Have)
Technical SEO
Structured Data (JSON-LD):Compliance: Google Search Central documentation.
Validation: 100% valid in Google Rich Results Test (warnings acceptable).
Coverage: All relevant schema.org objects rendered on every page.
Breadcrumbs: Must be present in JSON-LD.
Meta Tags: Complete Open Graph (OG) tags, Twitter Cards, and standard meta descriptions.
Performance: Optimized for Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS).
Target: Green scores on PageSpeed Insights.
4. Maintenance & Durability
Durability: Static-first approach ensuring long-term availability (10+ years) on a CDN (e.g., Cloudflare) with low cost and low risk of hacking.
Dynamic Features: Use SaaS solutions for dynamic needs (e.g., Stripe for payments/donations, external form services) to avoid backend maintenance.
Workflow: Content updates via Markdown files.
5. Nice to Have (Optional)
Rich Results: Implementation of FAQ, Q&A, and other Google rich cards.
CMS: Webflow is an acceptable alternative if Hugo is not viable, though Hugo is strongly preferred for performance and durability.
6. Possible Recommended Themes to be based on for maintanibilty
Based on the requirements for JSON-LD, Commercial License (MIT), Native i18n, and Performance, the following themes should be considered:
1. HugoBlox (formerly Wowchemy)
Github Repo: hugoblox/hugo-blox-builder
Why: Natively supports rich JSON-LD (Schema.org), multilingual (i18n), and modular landing page blocks.
Commercial Use: MIT License (free version).
Cons: Can be complex due to many features; requires disabling unused modules for maximum speed.
2. PaperMod
Github Repo: adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod
Why: Extremely fast (perfect 100/100 scores), native JSON-LD and OpenGraph support, simple i18n.
Commercial Use: MIT License.
Fit: "Profile Mode" or generic home info mode works well for single-product pages. Very minimal maintenance.
3. Magnolia
Github Repo: gohugothemes/hugo-theme-magnolia
Why: Designed specifically for small business/landing pages with i18n support out of the box.
Commercial Use: MIT License.
Fit: Good visual balance between a blog and a product site without heavy customization.
