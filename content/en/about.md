## Our Mission

EpiSave is a seizure detection system designed to protect people with epilepsy by providing real-time alerts to their caregivers. Using commercially available Android smartwatches, EpiSave monitors for generalized convulsive seizures (GCS) and sends SMS notifications with GPS location data when a seizure is detected.

## Why It Matters

Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP) is the leading cause of death among people with epilepsy. Faster detection and response times can significantly reduce this risk.
