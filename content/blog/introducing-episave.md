We are thrilled to introduce EpiSave, a seizure detection system for generalized convulsive seizures using commercially available Android smartwatches.

Our mission is simple: reduce the risk of SUDEP by ensuring caregivers are alerted as quickly as possible when a seizure occurs.

Stay tuned for more updates as we progress through development and testing.
