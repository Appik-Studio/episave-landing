## Detection Technology

EpiSave uses the accelerometer and heart rate sensors built into Android smartwatches (e.g., TicWatch Pro 5) to continuously monitor for movement patterns characteristic of generalized convulsive seizures.

## Alert System

When a seizure is detected, the companion smartphone app immediately sends an SMS to pre-configured caregiver contacts. The message includes the patient's current GPS location.

## Designed for Daily Life

The system runs in the background with minimal battery impact. No special hardware required — just a compatible Android smartwatch and a smartphone.

## Privacy & Security

All data is processed locally on the device. No personal health data is sent to external servers.
